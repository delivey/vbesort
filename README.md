# VBE-sort

Website with Lithuania state exam (high school graduation) math problems (and other examinations' problems), sorted in categories by topic.

Website is deployed here: [https://www.vbesort.lt](https://www.vbesort.lt)

The whole website is in Lithuanian, therefore, sorry, but if you don't speak Lithuanian, you will need to use Google Translate... No English translation is here yet.

Use, share, rate, suggest, contribute, support!

That's it. No more fun stuff. All the cool docs with docker etc. are in [v1.0.0](https://github.com/naglissul/vbe-sort/tree/v1.0.0), where I used AWS.
